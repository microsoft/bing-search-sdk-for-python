         insights query (see `insightsToken <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-custom-
         search/overview>`_\ ), you should always include the user's query term. Use this parameter only
         with the Image Search API.Do not specify this parameter when calling the Trending Images API.

        :param accept: The default media type is application/json. To specify that the response use
         `JSON-LD <http://json-ld.org/>`_\ , set the Accept header to application/ld+json.
        :type accept: str
        :param accept_language: A comma-delimited list of one or more languages to use for user
         interface strings. The list is in decreasing order of preference. For additional information,
         including expected format, see `RFC2616
         <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html>`_. This header and the `setLang
         <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-custom-search/overview>`_ query parameter are
         mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify the `cc
         <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-custom-search/overview>`_ query parameter. To
         determine the market to return results for, Bing uses the first supported language it finds
         from the list and combines it with the cc parameter value. If the list does not include a
         supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it
         uses an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market that Bing used,
         see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc query parameter only if you specify
         multiple languages. Otherwise, use the `mkt <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-custom-
         search/overview>`_ and `setLang <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-custom-
         search/overview>`_ query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
         in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON response objects. Any
         links to Bing.com properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
        :type accept_language: str
        :param user_agent_parameter: The user agent originating the request. Bing uses the user agent
         to provide mobile users with an optimized experience. Although optional, you are encouraged to
         always specify this header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used
         browser sends. For information about user agents, see `RFC 2616
         <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html>`_. The following are examples of user-
         agent strings. Windows Phone: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0;

        :type user_agent_parameter: str
        :param client_id: Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing
         API calls. Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key
         for assigning traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a user
         across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being
         assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience. For
         example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than the first, the experience
         may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s
         search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help
         improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance
         improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables
         higher click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should
         consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same
         end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a consistent user
         experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing APIs.
         Each user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client
         ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in
         the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT include this header in
         a request is the first time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each
         Bing API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To
         persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across
         all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device's
         persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that device, get
         the client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
         response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing
         requests for the user on that device. If you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not
         include cookies in the request.
        :type client_id: str
        :param client_ip: The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to
         discover the user's location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe search
         behavior. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the X-Search-
         Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
         Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the device's actual
         location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
        :type client_ip: str
        :param location: A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's
         geographical location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe search behavior and
         to return relevant local content. Specify the key/value pair as :code:`<key>`::code:`<value>`.
         The following are the keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat (required): The
         latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal to
         -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive
         values indicate northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location, in
         degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to
         +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
         longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of
         the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might
         be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
         (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location. (The UNIX timestamp
         is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading
         or direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting
         clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
         (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is
         traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The
         radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key
         only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information
         that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although optional, you are
         encouraged to always specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
         especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
         location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include this
         header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
        :type location: str
        :param aspect: Filter images by the following aspect ratios. All: Do not filter by
         aspect.Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the aspect parameter. Square: Return
         images with standard aspect ratio. Wide: Return images with wide screen aspect ratio. Tall:
         Return images with tall aspect ratio.
        :type aspect: str or ~custom_image_search_client.models.ImageAspect
        :param color: Filter images by the following color options. ColorOnly: Return color images.
         Monochrome: Return black and white images. Return images with one of the following dominant
         colors: Black, Blue, Brown, Gray, Green, Orange, Pink, Purple, Red, Teal, White, Yellow.
        :type color: str or ~custom_image_search_client.models.ImageColor
        :param country_code: A 2-character country code of the country where the results come from. For
         a list of possible values, see `Market Codes <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-
         custom-search/overview>`_. If you set this parameter, you must also specify the `Accept-
         Language <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-custom-search/overview>`_ header. Bing
         uses the first supported language it finds from the languages list, and combine that language
         with the country code that you specify to determine the market to return results for. If the
         languages list does not include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and
         market that supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results
         instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language query
         parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang
         query parameters. This parameter and the `mkt <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-
         custom-search/overview>`_ query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
        :type country_code: str
        :param count: The number of images to return in the response. The actual number delivered may
         be less than requested. The default is 35. The maximum value is 150. You use this parameter
         along with the offset parameter to page results.For example, if your user interface displays 20
         images per page, set count to 20 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results.For each
         subsequent page, increment offset by 20 (for example, 0, 20, 40). Use this parameter only with
         the Image Search API.Do not specify this parameter when calling the Insights, Trending Images,
         or Web Search APIs.
        :type count: int
        :param freshness: Filter images by the following discovery options. Day: Return images
         discovered by Bing within the last 24 hours. Week: Return images discovered by Bing within the
         last 7 days. Month: Return images discovered by Bing within the last 30 days.
        :type freshness: str or ~custom_image_search_client.models.Freshness
        :param height: Filter images that have the specified height, in pixels. You may use this filter
         with the size filter to return small images that have a height of 150 pixels.
        :type height: int
        :param id: An ID that uniquely identifies an image. Use this parameter to ensure that the
         specified image is the first image in the list of images that Bing returns. The `Image
         <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-custom-search/overview>`_ object's imageId field
         contains the ID that you set this parameter to.
        :type id: str
        :param image_content: Filter images by the following content types. Face: Return images that
         show only a person's face. Portrait: Return images that show only a person's head and
         shoulders.
        :type image_content: str or ~custom_image_search_client.models.ImageContent
        :param image_type: Filter images by the following image types. AnimatedGif: Return only
         animated GIFs. Clipart: Return only clip art images. Line: Return only line drawings. Photo:
         Return only photographs(excluding line drawings, animated Gifs, and clip art). Shopping: Return
         only images that contain items where Bing knows of a merchant that is selling the items. This
         option is valid in the en - US market only.Transparent: Return only images with a transparent
         background.
        :type image_type: str or ~custom_image_search_client.models.ImageType
        :param license: Filter images by the following license types. All: Do not filter by license
         type.Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the license parameter. Any: Return
         images that are under any license type. The response doesn't include images that do not specify
         a license or the license is unknown. Public: Return images where the creator has waived their
         exclusive rights, to the fullest extent allowed by law. Share: Return images that may be shared
         with others. Changing or editing the image might not be allowed. Also, modifying, sharing, and
         using the image for commercial purposes might not be allowed. Typically, this option returns
         the most images. ShareCommercially: Return images that may be shared with others for personal
         or commercial purposes. Changing or editing the image might not be allowed. Modify: Return
         images that may be modified, shared, and used. Changing or editing the image might not be
         allowed. Modifying, sharing, and using the image for commercial purposes might not be allowed.
         ModifyCommercially: Return images that may be modified, shared, and used for personal or
         commercial purposes. Typically, this option returns the fewest images. For more information
         about these license types, see `Filter Images By License Type
         <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=309768>`_.
        :type license: str or ~custom_image_search_client.models.ImageLicense
        :param market: The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the country where the
         user is making the request from. However, it could be a different country if the user is not
         located in a country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
         :code:`<language code>`-:code:`<country code>`. For example, en-US. The string is case
         insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see `Market Codes
         <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-custom-search/overview>`_. NOTE: If known, you are
         encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying the market helps Bing route the request and
         return an appropriate and optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in
         `Market Codes <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-custom-search/overview>`_\ , Bing
         uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is subject to change. This
         parameter and the `cc <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-custom-search/overview>`_
         query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
        :type market: str
        :param max_file_size: Filter images that are less than or equal to the specified file size. The
         maximum file size that you may specify is 520,192 bytes. If you specify a larger value, the API
         uses 520,192. It is possible that the response may include images that are slightly larger than
         the specified maximum. You may specify this filter and minFileSize to filter images within a
         range of file sizes.
        :type max_file_size: long
        :param max_height: Filter images that have a height that is less than or equal to the specified
         height. Specify the height in pixels. You may specify this filter and minHeight to filter
         images within a range of heights. This filter and the height filter are mutually exclusive.
        :type max_height: long
        :param max_width: Filter images that have a width that is less than or equal to the specified
         width. Specify the width in pixels. You may specify this filter and maxWidth to filter images
         within a range of widths. This filter and the width filter are mutually exclusive.
        :type max_width: long
        :param min_file_size: Filter images that are greater than or equal to the specified file size.
         The maximum file size that you may specify is 520,192 bytes. If you specify a larger value, the
         API uses 520,192. It is possible that the response may include images that are slightly smaller
         than the specified minimum. You may specify this filter and maxFileSize to filter images within
         a range of file sizes.
        :type min_file_size: long
        :param min_height: Filter images that have a height that is greater than or equal to the
         specified height. Specify the height in pixels. You may specify this filter and maxHeight to
         filter images within a range of heights. This filter and the height filter are mutually
         exclusive.
        :type min_height: long
        :param min_width: Filter images that have a width that is greater than or equal to the
         specified width. Specify the width in pixels. You may specify this filter and maxWidth to
         filter images within a range of widths. This filter and the width filter are mutually
         exclusive.
        :type min_width: long
        :param offset: The zero-based offset that indicates the number of images to skip before
         returning images. The default is 0. The offset should be less than (\ `totalEstimatedMatches
         <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-custom-search/overview>`_ - count). Use this
         parameter along with the count parameter to page results. For example, if your user interface
         displays 20 images per page, set count to 20 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results.
         For each subsequent page, increment offset by 20 (for example, 0, 20, 40). It is possible for
         multiple pages to include some overlap in results. To prevent duplicates, see `nextOffset
         <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-custom-search/overview>`_. Use this parameter only
         with the Image API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the Trending Images API or the
         Web Search API.
        :type offset: long
        :param safe_search: Filter images for adult content. The following are the possible filter
         values. Off: May return images with adult content. If the request is through the Image Search
         API, the response includes thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the request
         is through the Web Search API, the response includes thumbnail images that are pixelated
         (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the Image Search API, the response doesn't include
         images with adult content. If the request is through the Web Search API, the response may
         include images with adult content (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do not
         return images with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market
         that Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch
         value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the
         response may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to.
         Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the
         possibility of adult content.
        :type safe_search: str or ~custom_image_search_client.models.SafeSearch
        :param size: Filter images by the following sizes. All: Do not filter by size. Specifying this
         value is the same as not specifying the size parameter. Small: Return images that are less than
         200x200 pixels. Medium: Return images that are greater than or equal to 200x200 pixels but less
         than 500x500 pixels. Large: Return images that are 500x500 pixels or larger. Wallpaper: Return
         wallpaper images. You may use this parameter along with the height or width parameters. For
         example, you may use height and size to request small images that are 150 pixels tall.
        :type size: str or ~custom_image_search_client.models.ImageSize
        :param set_lang: The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using the
         ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example, the language code for English is EN. The default
         is EN (English). Although optional, you should always specify the language. Typically, you set
         setLang to the same language specified by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings
         displayed in a different language. This parameter and the `Accept-Language
         <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-custom-search/overview>`_ header are mutually
         exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label in a
         user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any
         links to Bing.com properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
        :type set_lang: str
        :param width: Filter images that have the specified width, in pixels. You may use this filter
         with the size filter to return small images that have a width of 150 pixels.
